# Overview

This vignette documents the database schema and scraping pipeline design for the `ncaaBaseball` package. It defines the core data tables, their relationships, and the order in which scraping functions should be executed.

# Data Model

The following YAML schema defines all tables used in the package and their respective fields:

```yaml
`r readLines(system.file("schema/data_schema.yml", package = "ncaaBaseball")) %>% paste(collapse = "\n")`
```

# Scraping Sequence

1. **Team Dropdown Page** (`/teams/history`)
   Collects `org_id` and `school_name`.

2. **Team History Page** (`/teams/history?org_id=...`)
   Collects `season_id` and metadata per year.

3. **Team-Season Page** (`/teams/{season_id}`)
   Links to:

   * Schedule
   * Roster
   * Team Statistics
   * Game-by-Game logs

4. **Box Scores** (`/contests/{game_id}/box_score`)
   For detailed per-game data.

# Notes

* Sport code is fixed as `MBA`.
* Data may require validation due to inconsistent table formatting.
* `player_id` and `game_id` may be inferred from URLs or links in the HTML.

# End
